# Eject!

This is my setup for a new computer. I guess it is just dotfiles with a funny name.

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rossedman/eject/master/scripts/install)"
```

To run a backup with the latest upstream configuration run 

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rossedman/eject/master/scripts/backup)"
```
